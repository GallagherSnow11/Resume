                    <h2>Missionary Service</h2>
                        <p>Beginning in 2019, I went on a two year mission to Stockholm, Sweden for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. During this period of my life, I learned a second language, Swedish. I was able to learn how to approach strangers and share something that is important to me. 
                        This time helped me to understand how fun it truly is to see other people enjoy something that I can give them. Making the people of Sweden happy gave me so much satisfaction, and I developed a passion for making people happy. </p>

                        <p>I not only learned how to love people and giving them things that have made me happy, I also learned practical skills related to business. I learned how to run social media pages and how paid ads can be focused towards specific target markets. 
                        I also learned how to lead a team of people towards common goals through inspiration, communication, and teamwork.</p>
                        <h2>Customer Service</h2>
                        <p>When I was 16, I began working at a grocery store. At first my reasoning was that my mom would let me quit my piano lessons if I got a job, but I soon grew to love working in the retail industry. 
                        I worked at the midwestern grocery store, Jewel-Osco, for a year and a half while in high school and I progressed fairly quickly. When my family moved to Utah, midway through my senior year, I wanted to find myself a new job, and I went straight to the grocery store.</p>

                        <p>I started working for Associated Foods Stores at Maceys in 2018, and fell in love with their business model. The idea of having the best customer experience and providing "Happy Shopping" for their guests is a great format for success.</p>
                        <p>I began working on the front-end as a cashier. I had a lot of fun helping customers find what they were looking for, and making the workplace fun and exciting for both guests and employees.</p>
                        <center> <img src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/355801871_3533993130152829_147454061129008707_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p403x403&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=aee45a&_nc_ohc=6VEax7kz7fwAX_v-HuS&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=03_AdTf7fOZ9QgUw9gt3OJWrf2giCkfU-3qc-7wghc8H1OmKA&oe=64BC0E45" height="300" alt="Front-End at Maceys"></center>
                        <p>I quickly moved up from being a casheir to being a Front-End Supervisor, which gave me a lot more experience with direct customer service and gave me more responsibility for my co-workers. I also got to work more closely with the leadership of the store, giving me the chance to ask questions about the actual skills of running a business. </p>

                        <h2>Sales with BYU Continuing Education</h2>
                        <p>After being a part of the FlexGE program for a year, I learned a lot about how the program works and how it can be used to help students who want the best education available to them after receiving previous rejection from BYU. </p>
                        <p>My job with continuing Education consists of visiting high school counselors, informing them about the FlexGE program, helping them see the future benfits for their students. These interactions help the counselors recommend the program to their students, thus increasing the number of students receiving the benefits of a BYU education.</p>
                    
                        <h2>The It's Just Dinner Podcast (Internship)</h2>
                        <p>At the beginning of the January 2023 semester, I started an On-Campus Internsip with Dr. Tom Robinson of the Communications School and his podcast, "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0eKNPiw7BXgPcvpb5Oa4B0">The It's Just Dinner Podcast</a>". 
                        <Center><img src="https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/356415728_2264888973711654_3923454272697545963_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s403x403&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=aee45a&_nc_ohc=-u-7HkgdMggAX-_4p95&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&oh=03_AdTGv8QR6F_KXiEYSm9SbGMEBNrwpiXxJnpCac6QnlHZJQ&oe=64BEED54" height="200" alt="The It's Just Dinner Podcast Logo"></Center>
                        <P>I learned through the podcast, more about social media marketing, how to use surveys to learn more about a target market, and creating events surrounding the product. I also learned that one can market anything. It doesn't have to be a tangible object for you to show people the benefits. It broadened my vision for what marketing could accomplish.</P>
                        <p>The experience was a major success, increasing social media activity 1048% and increasing overall podcast listeners 333%.</p>

                        <h2>Bateman Collective</h2>
                        <p>In June 2023, I was offered an internship with Bateman Collective, a digital marketing agency dedicated to the real estate investment industry, headquartered in Lehi, Utah. While I have not been here long, I am very excited for the learning opportunities and experience that await.</p>
